# pbcm-upgrade

Created new repo with all updated Nextjs features. This was the path of least resistance since the other version of the app used a create-t3 stack w/ trpc.

It also gave me another good excuse to use the new stuff and continue getting familiar with the updates

Biggest thing I need to get better with for this site to be a lot nicer is finding a good pattern for data fetch and loading ui's rather than right now it's just a blank page.

Figuring out performance and other stuff as I go.
